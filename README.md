# Yak Stack

The Big Moo (supreme leader of all yakkind) was lounging on a hot, sunny beach when a tsunami warning came in. Thankfully, you're on duty, piloting the brand new Yak-O-Matic 3000, perfect for dropping yaks out of the sky.

Your mission is to strategically stack those yaks to construct impromptu bridges, towers and sacrificial battering rams to save The Big Moo from the tsunami.

Don't panic. Just Yak Stack.
